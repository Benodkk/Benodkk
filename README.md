## About me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Hi, I'm Daniel, a Front-end enthusiast who is looking for his first job as a programmer.

### How its started? 

I have a degree in civil engineering, which I obtained in February 2022 at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. After finishing my studies, I decided to take a break from civil engineering and try my hand at programming. I enjoyed it from the very beginning. In March 2022, I started a basic programming course at [The odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), and then I started the Full Stack JavaScript course, also at The Odin Project. However, I decided to skip the part related to Back-end and focused on developing my front-end skills. I deepened my knowledge of React in the [Advanced React course from Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/react). Since completing this course, I have been seeking new challenges and technologies that are essential for every front-end developer.

### How its going?

Currently, as part of my practice, I am creating my own projects, which you can see on my profile. I try to create projects that will demonstrate what I am capable of and help me find my first job as a programmer.
